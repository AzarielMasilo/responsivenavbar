    <h2>Saturday Market</h2>
            <h3>January 7th</h3>
            <strong class="opening-line">On Saturday, Dilara took us to the market.</strong>
            <p>It is a wonderfully electric mix of goods from all over the world - delightfully random.
              I dusted off my bargaining skills to buy a metal bracelet with camels on it  and Maggie bought
              a lapiz lazuli necklace from Afganistan.</p>
  
            <p>We took a catamaran from the marina to Failaka island where we got to explore a bit, relax on the bitch and go swimming. The water in the gulf is incredibly still.</p>
            <p>That night i hungout in a cafe with two freinds, drinking traditional lemonade with mint. It's delicious; maybe I should send in a flavor suggestion to Morano Gelato?</p>
